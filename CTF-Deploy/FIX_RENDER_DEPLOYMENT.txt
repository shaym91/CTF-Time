=====================================================
FIX: Requirements.txt Not Found
=====================================================

The error means your files didn't upload to GitHub properly.

SOLUTION: Push files from CTF-Deploy folder
=====================================================

Open PowerShell in the CTF-Deploy folder and run:

cd D:\WSL\CTF\crypto\CTF-Platform\CTF-Deploy

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add all CTF files"
git remote add origin https://github.com/shaym91/CTF-Time.git
git push -u origin main --force

This will properly upload all files!

=====================================================
AFTER PUSHING:
=====================================================

1. Go back to Render
2. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
3. Or just click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

Your deployment should work now!

=====================================================
VERIFY FILES ON GITHUB:
=====================================================

Go to: https://github.com/shaym91/CTF-Time

You should see:
✅ app.py
✅ requirements.txt
✅ templates/
✅ ctfd-import/
✅ README.md

If you don't see these, the push didn't work.

=====================================================
